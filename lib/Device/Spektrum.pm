=head1 NAME

  Device::Spektrum - Send packets compatible with the Spektrum RC protocol

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Device::Spektrum::Packet;
    my $packet = Device::Spektrum::Packet->new({
        throttle => 170,
        aileron => 200,
        elevator => 250,
        rudder => 800,
        gear => SPEKTRUM_LOW,
        aux1 => SPEKTRUM_MIDDLE,
        aux2 => SPEKTRUM_HIGH,

        # Optional; may correct problems with buggy implementations
        field_order => [qw(
            throttle
            aileron
            elevator
            rudder
            gear
            aux1
            aux2
        )],
    });
    
    my $encoded_packet = $packet->encode_packet;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Spektrum is a serial protocol that is compatible with many RC flight controllers. Using 
this module allows you to craft output packets compatible with these flight controllers. It 
supports up to 7 channels.

Data is sent over a serial connection with one start bit, 8 data bits, LSB, no parity, 
and one stop bit, all at 115.2Kbps. A 22 millisecond delay may be needed in between packets;
I had trouble getting the Naze32 to behave when the program sent data as fast as possible.

The C<field_order> parameter shouldn't be necessary, because the protocol uses a few 
identifier bits for each channel. However, some implementations out there hardcode the 
channel order to what common Spektrum recievers put out, so you may need to work around 
them with this parameter.

Most of the interesting parts of the API is in L<Device::Spektrum::Packet>, so read those 
docs for details.
