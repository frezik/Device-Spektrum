=head1 NAME

  Device::Spektrum::Packet - Represent a packet of Spektrum data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Device::Spektrum::Packet;
    my $packet = Device::Spektrum::Packet->new({
        throttle => 170,
        aileron => 200,
        elevator => 250,
        rudder => 800,
        gear => SPEKTRUM_LOW,
        aux1 => SPEKTRUM_MIDDLE,
        aux2 => SPEKTRUM_HIGH,
    });
    
    my $encoded_packet = $packet->encode_packet;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a single packet of Spektrum data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item * throttle

=item * aileron

=item * elevator

=item * rudder

=item * gear

=item * aux1

=item * aux2

=back

Each attribute takes an integer. These are typically in between 170 (exported as 
C<SPEKTRUM_LOW>) and 853 (C<SPEKTRUM_HIGH>). The protocol is technically capable of 
values between 0 and 1023, but servos and flight controllers may not be well-behaved outside
the typical range.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 encode_packet

Return a byte string containing the encoded packet.
